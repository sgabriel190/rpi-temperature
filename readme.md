# Temperature sensor with led warning project
## Author: Strilciuc Gabriel

## Description
This application runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero W and a breadboard. The sensor data is displayed on a website powered by Django and Celery.

The Django framework helps creating a quick web server and Celery is a Distributed Task Queue as the developer himself calls it, which helps the server-side tasks to be asynchronous and boost its response time.
